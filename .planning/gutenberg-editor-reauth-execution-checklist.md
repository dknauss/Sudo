# In-Editor Reauth — Execution Checklist (Milestone A → B)

**For the browser-capable session.** Ordered RED→GREEN TDD steps that turn the milestone
plan into executable work. Do them top to bottom; each code commit needs a fresh
pre-commit **reviewer-approved** flag (docs-only `.md` commits skip it). Hand the reviewer
the **C1–C4** checklist from the phase-2 plan on every review request for this feature.

**Branch:** `feat/gutenberg-reauth-increment-3` (PR #178). **Read first:** the "▶ START
HERE" PR comment, `gutenberg-editor-reauth-milestone-plan.md`, and (for B)
`gutenberg-editor-reauth-milestone-b-2fa-partial-brief.md`.

**Gate commands** (superuser sandbox → prefix PHP/composer with `COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1`):
- `composer test:unit` · `composer lint` · `composer analyse` (PHPStan **+** Psalm) · `composer verify:metrics`
- `composer verify:i18n` needs the WP-CLI shim on PATH (scratchpad `wpcli-bin`)
- Integration: `composer test:integration` **and** `WP_MULTISITE=1 composer test:integration` (the flag `bin/run-integration-tests.sh` forwards — `WP_TESTS_MULTISITE` alone silently runs single-site)
- E2E single-site: `npm run test:e2e:local` · multisite: `npm run test:e2e:local:multisite`
- After adding specs: update `docs/current-metrics.md` in the **same** commit (`verify:metrics` gates it)

---

## Step 0 — Rebase (no new tests; reconcile only)
- [ ] `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main` on `feat/gutenberg-reauth-increment-3` (9 behind). Reconcile `admin/js/wp-sudo-editor-reauth.js` + `includes/class-plugin.php` against the shipped Increment-1/2 code on `main`.
- [ ] `composer test:unit && composer lint && composer analyse && composer verify:metrics` green; force-push (`--force-with-lease`). Reviewer flag required (code touched by the rebase reconciliation).

## Step 1 — Modal grant E2E floor (EDITOR-06)  ← the demo you already saw, now automated
- [ ] **RED:** in `tests/e2e/specs/editor-reauth.spec.ts`, un-`fixme` **EDITOR-06** ("modal password grant re-dispatches the original request"). Drive a real gated action (Block Directory inserter → install/activate a block, e.g. *Icon Block*), assert the modal opens, enter `password`, assert grant + the original request completes + editor state intact.
- [ ] Reconcile the superseded snackbar tests **EDITOR-01/02/03/05** (`test.fixme`): delete or repoint them to the link-out-fallback path (they asserted Increment-1 behavior the modal now supersedes for non-2FA users). Keep **EDITOR-04** (normal error ≠ modal).
- [ ] **GREEN:** `npm run test:e2e:local` — EDITOR-04 + EDITOR-06 pass. Update `docs/current-metrics.md` E2E count.

## Step 2 — 2FA-bypass invariant (THE security gate)
- [ ] **RED (unit/integration):** a 2FA-enabled user's password-only path returns `2fa_pending` and **never** a granted session — assert `handle_ajax_auth` yields `2fa_pending` (not `authenticated`) and no `Sudo_Session` token is minted for a 2FA user on the password step.
- [ ] **RED (E2E):** 2FA account → editor gated action → modal password → **no grant** → link-out to the full challenge page.
- [ ] **GREEN:** both pass. This turns "password-only is safe" from a claim into an enforced guarantee; guards against a future bypass regression.

## Step 3 — Stale-nonce recovery
- [ ] **RED:** an aged/expired `wp_sudo_challenge` grant nonce (overnight-tab scenario, not a nonce-valid tab) → `refreshNonceAction` re-mints and the grant then succeeds (or one retry-on-`check_ajax_referer`-failure path). Assert the recovery, not just the happy path.
- [ ] **GREEN:** pass.

## Step 4 — REST re-dispatch boundaries
- [ ] **RED:** single-flight (one modal/snackbar) + concurrent `sudo_required` rejections queue and re-dispatch once on grant (Q3, don't double-fire). Batched `/batch/v1` envelope carrying a `sudo_required` inner response is **detected and surfaced** (snackbar), never a silent no-op (Q2, detect-only).
- [ ] **GREEN:** pass.

## Step 5 — Degradation + headless regression (C4, Q4)
- [ ] **RED:** rejection without a safe `challenge_url` → plain message, no "Reauthenticate" action; the UI never echoes the rule label (Q4). App-password/bearer `sudo_required` stays `challenge_url`-free (assert against the headless branch in `class-gate.php`).
- [ ] **GREEN:** pass.

## Step 6 — Password-manager / autofill matrix
- [ ] Manually verify the `createElement` modal password field against 1Password / Bitwarden / iCloud Keychain / browser built-ins; apply cheap markup fixes (field-markup rules, phase-2 Part 7). Record the matrix in the password-manager todo (`.planning/todos/pending/2026-07-05-password-manager-2fa-interaction.md`).

## Step 7 — Full gate sweep (single-site AND multisite)
- [ ] `npm run test:e2e:local` **and** `npm run test:e2e:local:multisite` green (the challenge-URL routing differs on multisite).
- [ ] `composer test:integration` **and** `WP_MULTISITE=1 composer test:integration` green.
- [ ] `composer analyse` (PHPStan+Psalm), `composer lint`, `composer verify:metrics`, `composer verify:i18n` green.
- [ ] **Security-scoped review of the real diff** with the C1–C4 checklist named explicitly.
- [ ] Release notes state the 2FA-users-link-out fallback plainly (branch readme already does).

## Step 8 — Un-draft Milestone A
- [ ] All Step 1–7 boxes checked → mark PR #178 ready for review; maintainer merges.

## Milestone B (after A merges) — from the reviewed brief
Follow `gutenberg-editor-reauth-milestone-b-2fa-partial-brief.md`. TDD order:
1. **RED:** extract `render_two_factor_fields($user)`; assert `render_page()` output **byte-identical** (shared-renderer regression).
2. **RED:** `handle_ajax_2fa_partial()` — 403 without/with expired `2fa_pending`; `link_out` for WebAuthn-primary, **no-provider (hook-only)**, and unknown providers; markup for TOTP-primary.
3. **RED (the HIGH finding):** email-provider partial fetch is **single-flight + shares the `wp_sudo_resend_*` throttle** — no unbounded mail-send on re-fetch. (`Two_Factor_Email::authentication_page()` sends on render.)
4. **RED:** `wp_sudo_render_two_factor_fields` behaves in the new admin-ajax fire context (script/screen-dependent callback → link-out or documented plain-field requirement).
5. **RED (client):** serialize **all** injected-partial fields generically (no hardcoded `authcode`); handle the pending-expired 403 → link-out/restart (not "invalid code").
6. **RED (E2E, single-site + `WP_MULTISITE=1`):** TOTP in-modal grant → re-dispatch; WebAuthn → link-out (no dead form); email resend + shared cap; multisite asserts the partial resolves the **same per-site `2fa_pending` transient** the password step wrote.
7. Resolve **Q-B1** (default-deny `wp_sudo_2fa_modal_capable` filter vs. private curated map) in implementation review; security-scoped review of the new endpoint + email render-send behavior.
